            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                A plate of kare raisu or Japanese curry rice has the power to nourish the body and soul on even the coldest of days. While you can make Japanese curry—beloved for its mildly spicy, umami-rich flavor—from scratch, it’s an easy dish to throw together with just three ingredients. All you need is a box of curry roux cubes and your choice of protein and vegetable.

                Whenever I make Japanese curry, I’m always surprised at how quickly the dish comes together. The curry roux cubes melt into a pan of sautéed chicken, potatoes, and a couple cups of water in just a few minutes, resulting in a velvety sauce perfect for spooning over rice. Read on to find out how to make it for yourself.

            <ol class="recipe-lists">
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat and sauté the protein for about 5 minutes. Add potatoes and/or other vegetables, if using, and sauté for another 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the water and bring everything to a boil. Then lower the heat and simmer, covered, for about 15 minutes. </li>
