Simple website to display various recipes.

For now, this will only represent usage of HTML; since we haven't dived into CSS, nothing will look stylish or neat (yet).

This recipe website displays simple recipes for 3 different dishes. Each page contains links to every other page, and the homepage can access each recipe page at any time. Each page contains an image, description, ingredients, and steps for completion. This project will be updated further at a later time.
